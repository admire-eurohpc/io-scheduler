# LIBSLURMADMCLI
libslurmadmcli is a Slurm SPANK¹ plugin handling the ADMIRE adhoc
storage CLI. It is a simple interface between Slurm and the Scord
storage coordination service².

# INSTALLATION
See ../Makefile for details on how to compile libslurmadmcli.so. Note
that it only depends on the Slurm and the Scord C libraries, and
access to the slurm/spank.h header.

Once the shared object is compiled, it only needs to be moved
somewhere the Slurm plugin system can pick it up. For example, if
libslurmadmcli.so is installed in /usr/local/lib/, the following line
can be added to the Slurm plugin configuration file (usually
/etc/slurm/plugstack.conf)

	optional	/usr/local/lib/libslurmadmcli.so	scord_addr=ofi+tcp://127.0.0.1:52000 scord_proto=ofi+tcp://127.0.0.1 scordctl_bin=scord-ctl

The key-value pairs following the plugin are optional configuration
variables.
- scord_addr: The address to contact the Scord service in Mercury format
  (default to ofi+tcp://127.0.0.1:52000)
- scord_proto: The transport protocol to use in Mercury format (default
  to ofi+tcp).
- scordctl_bin: The scord-ctl binary to run on every node of an
  allocation, can be the path to an executable (default to scord-ctl).
